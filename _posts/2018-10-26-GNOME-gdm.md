My GNOME Ubuntu VM stuck at logo during reboot, after uninstall and reinstall Python 2.7. There's somebody on Ubuntu forums meet the same problem:  [gnome ubuntu doesn't boot up, stuck at logo with blinking process bar](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1789159). In this post, we can know about that problem due to gdm missing, and fortunately, I can ssh into the system even if it stuck at logo.

It's easy to type **sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm**, and figure out gdm package is missing.

Thus, just use **sudo apt-get install gdm**, and reboot. GNOME Ubuntu is back; However, there's another problem is: terminal in GNOME Ubuntu is missing too.

Type **sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal**, and wait for a while.

Everything is back again.
